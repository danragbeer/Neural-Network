This project defines a simple neural network that is trained to read the
emnist letters dataset. The best accuracy evaluated was 87.9% with 2 layers of
5000 nodes each, and trained over 30 epochs. Cross validation is over 4 folds.
Must uncomment the cross_validate() function call to run cross validation.
